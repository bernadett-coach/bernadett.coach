                    <p>
                        <em>If you are committed</em> to your personal growth and <em>to make the best of your
                        life</em>, I invite you to join me for a <em>4 months</em> period of weekly or bi-weekly
                        coaching sessions. We will use either Skype or Zoom for our <em>90mins online</em>
                        discussion and exercise combo. My toolbox contains elements from my Co-active Coaching,
                        Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) trainings. Although inner
                        work is something serious, I will show you how to make it fun.
                    </p>

                    <p>During the process you will get answers to the following questions among others:</p>

                <h2>Why coaching?</h2>

                <p>
                    I like seeing happy people around me and love to make them happy. After helping a few friends and
                    family members with success, I decided to make my passion my work, which is
                    <em>supporting people</em> in helping themselves, asking the right questions to realize how to
                    live the life they love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my experience coaching is a fun and efficient method, which I used personally to build a
                    <em>conscious lifestyle</em>, to make my dreams come true and to find my inner peace.
                </p>

                </div>

                <h2>Why men?</h2>

                <p>
                    Often Men are portrayed as tough <em>superheroes</em>, who have to deal with everything without a
                    flinch. Speaking about emotions, problems, or a path to happiness is seen as feminine and is not
                    something that comes easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All too often do I see men being <em>stressed, frustrated or simply miserable</em>, where the reason
                    is buried so deep that even they don't know the true reason.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have spent 10 years of my life learning and <em>supporting my own father</em> to open up and find
                    out what really matters to him. Coincidentally, this also saved his marriage, created meaningful
                    relationships and resulted in a more fulfilling life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Having had first hand experiences with how <em>profound of a change</em> inner work can be, I now
                    wish to share my learnings and tools with you.
                </p>

                    <div class="testimonial__text">
                        <p>For the last couple of years, I have been looking at living closer to my purpose in every area of my life. Somewhere half way, I met Bernadett and we started having periodic sessions, which helped me go for my most ambitious goals. Coaching sessions with Bernadett are fun and energising. It doesn’t feel like work, yet progress is significant and she knows how to support you to get a step further than your comfort zone. And this is where the magic begins.</p>

                    <div class="testimonial__text">
                        <p>I met Bernadett in Bali. She is a very open and positive person, she easily talks about her own challenges, which made it easy for me to build trust. She has now coached me during 10 sessions and the results have been amazing. One thing I appreciate a lot about her, is that she is taking her own medicine. She continuously challenges herself as she does with me. Another thing i noticed: the more I let go of control of the content, the better it works. She managed to make coaching fun and very effectful. I can highly recommend her as a coach.</p>

                    <div class="testimonial__text">
                        <p>Perhaps oddly, I started to consider turning to a coach when I felt I got the major areas of my life on the right track. But that was when I felt ready to seek external help to enter a newer dimension. I was hesitant whether coaching would be my thing, but I gave it a shot, and the discovery call with Bernadett exceeded my high expectations. Now I've been through 5 sessions and I can tell that I am transforming for the better week by week, and am able to see the steps on my path clearly further on. It is very exciting.</p>

                        <p>Bernadett has helped me through some serious decisions and a low point as well. Her ability to catch you when you are lying to yourself and confront you about it in a gentle, compassionate fashion, is incredibly helpful for helping you fulfill your dreams.</p>
